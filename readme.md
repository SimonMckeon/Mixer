##what?
My own personal launchpad for a quick and structured beginning to Sass projects depending on Bourbon.

My main aim was to create a solid base to quickly begin projects depending on Bourbon. I aimed to keep it as low level as possible, not including components, such as nav bars, and using as many variables as are needed to make customization as easy and painless as possible.

## why?
Although Bitters built by thoughtbot is a wonderful base for any project depending on Bourbon, I found myself constantly changing, adding and removing the same few components. 

## What's included?
- Customizable variables
- Typography
- Lists
- Forms
- Buttons
- Tables

## To add
- Labels
- Alerts
